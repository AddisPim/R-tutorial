## History
R is a statistical programming language created and named after statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. Initially, R was created in 1993 with the purpose of teaching introductory statistics where Ihaka and Gentleman were both professors at, the University of Auckland, New Zealand. R was later released for the general public in June of 1995. Since R was made for statistical analysis, statisticians and data miners are the primary users of this programming language. Its capabilities include but are not limited to data cleaning, exploration, manipulation, and machine learning.


## Installing R
1. Click on this link [Installing R](https://www.r-project.org)
2. After clicking on the link you should see a bold "**download R**" towards the top of the page, click this link.
3. After clicking the link from Step 2, you should see a list of countries with various links, scroll down to your country and choose a CRAN location (a mirror site) by pressing the link.
4. Now you should see several links that say "Download R for[operating system]" Select the link that matches your operating system.
5. Now you will be given the option to download R, for macOS make sure to use the latest version that matches your device.

## Installing RStudio
In order to run R we must download an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), in this case, we will be installing RStudio as our IDE of choice. Visual Studio Code is another IDE commonly used for R, but RStudio provides a more user-friendly interface and includes a larger variety of statistical libraries that can be utilized for R.

The link for Installing RStudio is below:

# Running R 
We will be writing a simple "Hello World" program in R, to make sure everything is running smoothly.

## Hello World
These instructions were written specifically for macOS users, the instructions will vary per operating system.
1. Once you have finished Installing R and RStudio, open up RStudio.
2. On the top left corner under **File**, hover over **New File** and select **R Script**.
3. Using the R Script, which will be the top left pane in Rstudio (also called the Source Pane), write **"Hello World"** (make sure this is written in double quotation marks). Now run this line of code.
4. The bottom left pane, which is called the Console Pane, is where our output to our code will appear. After following Step 4, you should see the following output.

```R
> "Hello World"
[1] "Hello World"
```

5. Now make sure to save this file by clicking **File**, and **Save As...** and name this file **HELLOWORLD.R**

### Commenting with RStudio
Commenting on your code is essential when writing various lines of code, this helps you keep track of what every line or program does.
To comment in RStudio just use the "#" and proceed to write your comment. This comment won't interfere with the rest of your code. Now you try!

After making your comments, your screen should look something like this:
```R
#This is how to make a comment in your code
"Hello World"
```
